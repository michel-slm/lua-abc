abc: Abstract Base Classes
==========================

An implementation of Python's abc (Abstract Base Classes) pattern for Lua.

abc can be used to add abstract methods to classes (or plain tables), and comes with a verifier to verify that a class or table does not define, or inherit, any of these abstract methods.
